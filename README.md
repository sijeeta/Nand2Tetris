## Project01 ðŸŒŸ

Writing hdl file for basic gates from NAND Gate and using the same to create other gates

- Basic Gates: AND, OR, XOR, NOT, Mux , DMux
- 16 bit Gates using basic gates: AND16 , NOT16, OR16 , Mux16 
- Multiple input to two 16 bit output or viceversa :Or8Way , Mux4Way16 , Mux8Way16, DMux4Way , DMux8Way


## Project02 ðŸŒŸ

Writing hdl file for basic operations

- HalfAdder : Has two input and outputs a sum and carry
- FullAdder : Using two halfadder
- Add16 : Adds two 16 bit inputs using one half adder and 15 full addder
- Inc16 : Increments a 16 bit input by +1 value using Add16
- ALU : Arithmetic Logic Unit using various Mux input and OR gate
