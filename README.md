## Project01 ðŸŒŸ

Writing hdl file for basic gates from NAND Gate and using the same to create other gates

- Basic Gates: AND, OR, XOR, NOT, Mux , DMux
- 16 bit Gates using basic gates: AND16 , NOT16, OR16 , Mux16 
- Multiple input to two 16 bit output or viceversa :Or8Way , Mux4Way16 , Mux8Way16, DMux4Way , DMux8Way
