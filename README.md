## Project01 ðŸŒŸ

Writing hdl file for basic gates from NAND Gate and using the same to create other gates

- Basic Gates: AND, OR, XOR, NOT, Mux , DMux
- 16 bit Gates using basic gates: AND16 , NOT16, OR16 , Mux16 
- Multiple input to two 16 bit output or viceversa :Or8Way , Mux4Way16 , Mux8Way16, DMux4Way , DMux8Way


## Project02 ðŸŒŸ

Writing hdl file for basic operations

- HalfAdder : Has two input and outputs a sum and carry
- FullAdder : Using two halfadder
- Add16 : Adds two 16 bit inputs using one half adder and 15 full addder
- Inc16 : Increments a 16 bit input by +1 value using Add16
- ALU : Arithmetic Logic Unit using various Mux input and OR gate


## Project03 ðŸŒŸ

Writing hdl file for memory Unit 

- Bit : Has two input and outputs a sum and carry
- Register : Use 1 bit to make Registers where combining such 8 Registers generate RAM8. Registers have one input and a load. 
- RAM : hdl file to create sucessive RAM unit like RAM8, RAM64, RAM512, RAM4K , RAM16K
- PC: Counters using Register, Incrementor and Mux16 chip to either load, increment or reset the input value

## Project04 ðŸŒŸ

Writing hack programming using Assembly language 

- 1) Mult.asm : This prgramming multiplies two number R0 and R1 using the method R1 added to itself R0 times.
